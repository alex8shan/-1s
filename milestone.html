    <h3>PHP:</h3>
    It is clear that PHP is the backbone of this project. It is being used to display pages, log users in and interact with database.



    <h3>Database:</h3>
    In database, there are 5 tables being created for this project:
    <ul>
        <li>Album: This table is used to display album info of the song, includes: album ID(auto increment, primary), album title,
            artist, genre and artworkPath.</li>
        <li>Artist:This table is used to display artist info of the song, includes: artist ID(auto increment, primary) and artist
            name.
        </li>
        <li>Genre: This table is used to display genre info of the song, includes: genre ID(auto increment, primary) and genrename.</li>
        <li>Song: This table is used to display song info, includes: song ID(auto increment, primary), song title, artist, genre,
            song duration, musicPath, albumOrder and number of plays.</li>
        <li>User: This is the only table that is not associated with songs. It includes user ID(auto increment, primary), firstName,
            lastName, email, password, signupDate and profilePic </li>
    </ul>
    Song informatinos are pre-programmed inside of database so the user cannot change it. However they can change the user table
    by signing up.
    <h3>JavaScript:</h3>
    Responsible for playing music audios, including previous/next song, pause/play and looping.
    <br> The way to do it is to create
    <a href="http://ice.truman.edu/~ms1723/+1s/assets/js/script.js">script.js</a> that uses audio object to do basic music playing functions.
    <br> Inside nowPlayingBar.php, we use
    <a href="http://ice.truman.edu/~ms1723/+1s/assets/js/script.js">script.js</a> to implement the UI(for example showing play/pause), as well as using Jquery(Ajax) to accomplish fetching
    song from database.
    <br>
    <a href="http://ice.truman.edu/~ms1723/ms3/assets/js/register.js">register.js</a> is responsible for showing/hiding sign in / register option in
    <a href="http://ice.truman.edu/~ms1723/+1s/register.phps">register.phps</a>.
    <br>

    <h3>Things to be done:</h3>
    If we had more time, we would like to do the following things that is in our plan:
    <ul>
        <li>Create playlist for each user, where they can add/ delete songs they wish to play.</li>
        <li>Be able to search the song and album info</li>
    </ul>
