    Minghao, This site is very confusing and completely unexplained. The whole point of annotations is for you to explain what
    you did for the milestone. Most of the links here go to pages that don't exist. You have an interface that plays the
    one musical track that seems to actually exist (HAHA Style). That seems to work, but I expect that you just got that
    from a library or something. But of course, I can't tell, because you don't tell me. This is full of php and database
    stuff that has nothing to do with Milestone 3.
    <br> It is fine to be ahead, but you need to make it clear what is Milestone 3 and what I am evaluating. It is fine to get
    Javascript code from other sites, but you need to be clear about that, explain what you are doing and make it clear what
    you wrote yourself. For now you get 8/15 on this assignment. If you think you deserve more points, make it clear to me
    what you did in Javascript for Milestone 3 to deserve more points.

    <br>There are also much more things in comment to explain how things works in "JSDLKFJLSKDJFLregister.js"
