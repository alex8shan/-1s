    Minghao, 
    <br>This site is very confusing and completely unexplained. The whole point of annotations is for you to explain what
    you did for the milestone. Most of the links here go to pages that don't exist. You have an interface that plays the
    one musical track that seems to actually exist (HAHA Style). That seems to work, but I expect that you just got that
    from a library or something. But of course, I can't tell, because you don't tell me. This is full of php and database
    stuff that has nothing to do with Milestone 3.
    <br> It is fine to be ahead, but you need to make it clear what is Milestone 3 and what I am evaluating. It is fine to get
    Javascript code from other sites, but you need to be clear about that, explain what you are doing and make it clear what
    you wrote yourself. For now you get 8/15 on this assignment. If you think you deserve more points, make it clear to me
    what you did in Javascript for Milestone 3 to deserve more points.

    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
    <h4>Files:<a href="http://ice.truman.edu/~ms1723/+1s/assets/js/script.js">script.js</a> and <a href="http://ice.truman.edu/~ms1723/+1s/includes/nowPlayingBar.phps">nowPlayingBar.phps</a> where I used obtrusive JavaScript. Comments for functions are included in order to explain more.</h4>
    <p>Major Reference: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_av_dom.asp, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIOLT-2IW8 and https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_audio_play.asp talked
    about how to do basic play/pause part of song playing. https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_audio.asp is used to help creating the audio object to perform all the operations.
    <br>For the most part I would just lookup how a specific implementation would work in JavaScript and our group came up with the entire design part.</p>
