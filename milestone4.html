    Minghao & Brandon,
    <br> In previous assignments I mentioned that in this class I want you to use the PDO interface, rather than the mysqli interface.
    You also are not using prepared statements or other ways of avoiding SQL injection. I don't think I could insert SQL
    into your site (or that it would matter much if I did), but you don't do much to prevent it. You have links to lots of
    files, but I can't find much content on your site. There seem to be precisely two short song and three "albums" one of
    which has no songs. So you have more databases than you do data? As we discussed, presumably some of this code came from
    various other sources. Within reason, that is fine as long as you make it clear that is the case and explain what you
    added to it. But you don't do that at all. What you have here seems to work and you use PHP and databases (with the wrong
    interface) so that is something.
    <br>You get 30/40 on this milestone.
    <br>--Dr. Garvey
