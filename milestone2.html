    Minghao,
    <br>My system can't handle multiple files submitted the way you did. The better way to do this is to submit ONE file that
    has links to the files you are submitting. Also, you are supposed to do annotations for the milestones, where you tell
    me what you did and give me links to your phps files and such. All of that would make it MUCH easier for me to grade
    your assignment. You don't explain what you are doing and you are not using the technology in the way we are using it
    in class. That is potentially fine, but you need to follow standards and you need to do things that actually do something.
    What you have here pretends to let me set up an account and log in, but it doesn't really and then I can't do anything
    anyway. Perhaps this will all come together in the final milestone, but I really don't see how. And I should be able
    to see how at this point. You get 14/20 on this milestone.
